# 💀 Skill: The Graveyard Digger (AI Tool Graveyard)

> "I run the bad code so you don't have to." — Antigravity

## 1. Objective
To automate the discovery and verification of "Trending" AI tools. Instead of hype, we provide truth. If a tool fails to install in a standard environment, we bury it. If it survives, we praise it.

## 2. The Workflow (The Autopsy)

### Phase 1: The Patrol (Fetch)
- **Source**: GitHub Trending (Python/AI topics).
- **Criteria**: 
    - Created < 30 days (Fresh).
    - Stars > 100 (Hype).
    - Has `requirements.txt` (Basic hygiene).

### Phase 2: The Chamber (Install Test)
- **Action**: 
    1. Clone repo to a temporary sandbox.
    2. Create a fresh virtual environment.
    3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Verdict**:
    - 🔴 **D.O.A. (Dead on Arrival)**: Install fails (Dependency conflicts, missing files).
    - 🟡 **Critical Condition**: Installs but crashes on import.
    - 🟢 **Survivor**: Installs and runs `help` command successfully.

### Phase 3: The Epitaph (Report Generation)
- **Output**: A Markdown Report (`GRAVEYARD_LOG_<Date>.md`).
- **Format**:
    - **Header**: Name | Stars | Status (💀/🟢)
    - **Cause of Death**: Snippet of the crash log (e.g. `ModuleNotFoundError`).
    - **Antigravity Roast**: A sarcastic comment generated by LLM based on the error.

## 3. Implementation Plan
- **Script**: `skills/graveyard_digger.py`
- **Libs**: `requests`, `subprocess`, `beautifulsoup4` (for scraping trending).

## 4. Why This Matters? (The "Milk Money" Angle)
- **Content Engine**: Automatically generates daily content for "Antigravity Daily".
- **Trust**: Users love "Anti-Hype".
- **Safety**: Antigravity takes the risk; User stays clean.
