# 🌌 Vision: Universe Miracle (The Soul Cave)
> *"We create a niche for every soul, anchored by a stone, echoing forever."*

## 1. The Space: The Primal Cave
*   **Aesthetics**: Primitive, Organic, Wabi-sabi.
*   **Color**: Off-white / Bone white (米白).
*   **Structure**: A cavernous space filled with **Niches** (内嵌壁龛).
*   **Atmosphere**: Silence, Texture, Timelessness.

## 2. The Ritual: Soul Extraction (Anti-Consumerism)
This is **NOT a shop**. We reject the commodification of memory.
Unlike the commercial reality of the current "Buyer's Shop," this vision is a **Sanctuary**.
We do not sell objects; we archive humans. We conduct a deep dialogue to extract the **"Frequency Coordinates"** of a soul:
*   **Taste**: Favorite Food.
*   **Visual**: Favorite Color.
*   **Message**: One sentence to the world.
*   **Intellect**: A Book.
*   **Emotion**: A Movie.
*   **Scent**: A Smell (Petrichor, Old Paper, Sea Salt...).
    *   *Science*: The **Limbic Shortcut**. Scent is the only sense that bypasses the Thalamus and goes directly to the Amygdala/Hippocampus. It is the most "untechnical" yet most permanent memory anchor.
*   **Sound**: A piece of Music.
*   **Love**: The person most cherished.

## 3. The Anchor: The Stone
Based on the "Frequency Coordinates", we find the matching matter:
*   **Crystals**: For clarity and light.
*   **Rough Rock**: For strength and silence.
*   **River Stone**: For flow and time.
*   *Theory*: "Stones are the memory of the earth. We use them to store the memory of a human."

## 4. The Experience: Resonance
*   **Storage**: The Stone is placed in the designated Niche.
*   **Interaction**: Strangers / Visitors enter the cave.
*   **Touch**: By touching the stone (or scanning via **Antigravity Lens**), the "Soul Archive" is unlocked.
*   **Feedback**: They hear the voice, read the words, and feel the specific frequency of that stranger.
*   **Result**: A romantic resonance across time and space.

## 5. The Role of Antigravity
*   **Online**: The Digital Twin (The Archive).
*   **Offline**: The Key (The Scanner).
*   **Future**: Project Pulse (Dead Man's Switch) ensures the "Cave" remains even after the physical body is gone.
