## Part 1: The "Return or Keep" Verdict (Avene Cicalfate)
**Decision: KEEP IT (留着).**

*   **Why?**
    *   **Vaseline** is just a "Raincoat" (Occlusive). It traps moisture but also heat. If you itch from heat, Vaseline makes it worse.
    *   **Avene Cicalfate (大白霜)** is a "Medicine" (Zinc Oxide + Copper + Sucralfate).
        *   **Zinc** calms inflammation and itching.
        *   **Sucralfate** accelerates healing.
    *   It is the best SOS tool for "Mysterious Itches" and "Broken Skin".
*   **The Math**: It costs ~100 RMB. If it saves you one trip to the dermatologist, it earns back 5x my milk money.
*   **Usage**: Don't smear it all over. Just "Thick Apply" (厚敷) on the itchy spots properly.

## Part 2: The Pitch Strategy (江苏有线)

**Client Profile (江苏有线)**:
*   **Type**: SOE / Traditional Media Giant.
*   **Pain Point**: "How to stay relevant in the TikTok/AI era?" They have authority, but they lack "Internet Sense" (网感) and "Tech Modernity".
*   **Your Value**: You are not just a copywriter. You are a **"Digi-Sapiens" (数智化创作者)**. You bring the "AI-Augmented" speed and future perspective.

### 🌟 Service Profile: "Antigravity Creative Lab"
*Instead of sending a messy folder of Word docs, we present a formulated identity.*

#### 1. Introduction (The Hook)
> "We provide **'High-Dimensional' Content Strategy**. Combining traditional 4A storytelling depth with modern AI-driven efficiency. We don't just write copy; we design information architecture."

#### 2. Selected Works (The Proof)
*Don't just show them ads. Show them 'Thinking'.*

*   **Case A: The Manifesto (Depth)**
    *   **Work**: *Editorial: God vs Human (The Turing Siblings)*
    *   **Label**: **"Technological Humanism" (科技人文)**
    *   **Relevance to Client**: Shows you can handle "Grand Narratives" (宏大叙事) suitable for SOEs, but make them touching and modern.

*   **Case B: The Visual-Verbal Fusion (Clarity)**
    *   **Work**: *Skills Hackathon Poster V4*
    *   **Label**: **"Information Visualization" (信息可视化)**
    *   **Relevance**: SOEs have complex policies/products. You can turn boring text into clear, engaging visual maps (Timeline/Brackets).

*   **Case C: The Curator (Speed)**
    *   **Work**: *Antigravity Daily / AI Tool Graveyard*
    *   **Label**: **"Trend Sensitivity" (趋势敏锐度)**
    *   **Relevance**: Shows you can help them capture hot topics instantly.

#### 3. Quotation Strategy (The Trap)
*Don't give a single cheap price. Give them options.*

*   **Option A: The Copy Hand (Execution)**
    *   **Service**: Basic rewriting, press releases.
    *   **Price**: ¥X,000 / Month (Retainer).
    *   **Role**: Vendor.

*   **Option B: The Strategy Brain (Partnership) -> RECOMMEND**
    *   **Service**:
        *   Monthly Content Planning (The "Magazine" approach).
        *   Key Visual/Conceptual Copy (The "Manifesto").
        *   **Bonus**: "AI Trend Consulting" (You tell them what's new in tech).
    *   **Price**: ¥X,000 * 1.5 / Month.
    *   **Role**: Consultant.
