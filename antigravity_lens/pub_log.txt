Resolving dependencies...
Note: path is pinned to version 1.8.3 by flutter_test from the flutter SDK.
See https://dart.dev/go/sdk-version-pinning for details.


Because every version of flutter_test from sdk depends on path 1.8.3 and antigravity_lens depends on path ^1.9.0, flutter_test from sdk is forbidden.
So, because antigravity_lens depends on flutter_test from sdk, version solving failed.
